# GXTO | Mobile Game for React Native

![mockup](https://i.imgur.com/ZLp8pLb.jpg)

This is a small game of tic-tac-toe developed on React Native.

The purpose of this project was to get experience with RN (since I had only worked on ReactJS thus far) 
and also develop something fun for my nephew and brother to spend some time together.

The game is fairly simple: you tap on the spaces of the screen to form a row with the figure assigned first (crosses or circles)
and once one of the players forms a row, they win. 

In the event that nobody wins, there is a "play again" button to restart the game.
